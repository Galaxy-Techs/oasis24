                        <p data-aos="fade-up">
                            2021 was a pivotal year in my life as I sought divine guidance for my marital journey. <br> <br>
                            Fast forward to the month of August I was scrolling through my friend's WhatsApp status updates when I stumbled upon a picture of a lady. Her face captivated me, and I knew in my spirit that she was meant to be my wife, in fact, those were the exact words I muttered to myself that day.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up">
                            After some inquiries about her, I learned of her deep love for God and her role as a song minister, which intrigued me even more. I discovered that her birthday was in a few days and decided to call and express my appreciation for her devotion to Jesus and dedication to kingdom service. This simple gesture marked the beginning of our friendship.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up">
                            As the days passed, our friendship blossomed, and we found ourselves talking every day. Eventually, I traveled from Akure to Lagos to meet her in person, and our connection only grew stronger. In November of the same year, after spending more time together and getting to know each other deeply, I mustered the courage to express my desire for a relationship with her shortly afterwards, she answered on the affirmative following her time of prayers.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up">
                            Today, as we discuss marriage, I am filled with joy knowing that Taiwo Lisa is not only my partner but also the second-best decision I've ever made, next to giving my heart to Jesus. She is everything I could have asked for and more; I eagerly anticipate embarking on life's journey with her by my side.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2 data-aos="fade-down">Bride's Story</h2>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up">
                            Three years before we met, God took me out of a relationship that wasn't His will for me. I told God that period, "Lord, just as you have taken me out of this wrong relationship, lead my husband to me and I to him". God told me He had settled it, so I didn't feel a need to pray for a husband anymore. I just had peace about it, stayed single to heal and became committed to serving God in every capacity.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up">
                            Then in September 2021, just before my birthday, I reminded God of His word as touching my relationship and marital life. I told God if He had settled it, He should lead my husband to me. On my birthday, I got a call from a stranger, he commended my dedication to God and service in his friend’s ministry then he prayed for me. That struck a chord but then we became friends.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up">
                            We met physically and from the moment I set eyes on him there was just something about him that resonated with my spirit. He made his intentions known then I told him about a friend who I had known longer than him who asked me to court him. Afterwards I gave him a timeline for my response.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up">
                            I was a bit reluctant to pray about him because I felt there was no way I would be with someone I hadn't been friends with for a long time but then I had been praying about the other guy and the time for my response had elapsed, but God said nothing about him being my husband. I told the other guy that I had not gotten a confirmation yet and he was patient. I also set boundaries, so he wouldn't feel like I was giving him hope.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up">
                            Few days to when I would give this amazing man of God a response I reluctantly prayed. I sat and began to pray and talk to God about the importance of this decision of a life partner and how I'm submitted to His will. As I prayed I got clear cut confirmations. I questioned those confirmations for its validity and the conviction was just so strong. I tarried for a few days with my response for it to be crystallized and also took out time to meet up with that other guy to ask specific questions that would reveal his mindset on certain key areas as touching purpose and destiny. After that conversation I was sure that guy was not mine.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up">
                            I finally gave a yes to my fiancé and it's been a beautiful journey of friendship and growth. The rest they say is history...
